                <h5> Personal Breakdown </h5>
                <p> 
                    My name is Anto Rados, and I am an iOS developer. I was born in Kakanj, Bosnia-Herzegovina and moved to Germany at the age of 3.  I lived in Stralsund, Germany for a little under 6 years before moving to the United States, finally settling in Cleveland, Ohio.  Throughout my life I have always been an active person which includes a love for soccer, basketball, football, tennis...  really any sport, and running.  I attended Bowling Green State University where I initially studied Engineering but discovered a love for programming, eventually switching majors to Computer Science and an Entrepreneurship minor.

                <h5> Professional Breakdown</h5>
                <p> 
                    My professional career started when I was 17, working for a law firm in Cleveland, Ohio as a Desktop Support Technician.  I left that position to attend Bowling Green State University, where I started a hardware repair business for some side-income. My main repairs ended up being mobile devices, which eventually (along with my roommate's influence) led to an interest in iOS development.  While pursuing my degree I started to learn iOS dev in my free time, which became a rarity after getting an internship in the financial sector.

                    After graduation I moved back to Cleveland, and continued studying iOS development while working full-time as a Desktop Support Specialist for a well-known faucet company.  Eventually I left my position to pursue my DevMtn certification (which is going well!).  With SwiftUI's release my focus switched from UIkit but my love for data structures, algorithms, and architecture carried over. I am currently working on 2 applications which are at various stages of completion (feasibility analisys, and planning) while also developing my personal website.
